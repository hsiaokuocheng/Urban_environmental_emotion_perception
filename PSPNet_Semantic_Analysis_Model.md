### How does PSPNET work?
- **PSPNet Semantic Analysis Model**

    "PSPNet helps us identify and categorize objects in images."

    PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) is a deep learning model for image semantic segmentation. Its key innovation lies in the "Pyramid Pooling Module," which understands image information at various scales to better analyze complex scenes.

    In brief, PSPNet enables computers to "understand" image content intelligently and accurately label objects and their proportions within the image.

### How to Use the Script: [Semantic Analysis using PSPNet](semantic_analysis.py) as example

This guide will walk you through the steps to use the Python script for performing semantic segmentation on images in a folder, saving the results to a CSV file.


#### Step 1: Install Required Python Packages

Ensure you have Python (3.x or higher) installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pillow
```

#### Step 2: Update Script Parameters
Open the [Semantic Analysis using PSPNet](semantic_analysis.py) and update the following variables to match your requirements:

```python
image_folder = "/path/to/your/image_folder"  # Replace with the path to the folder containing your images
save_csv_path = "/path/to/save/semantic_analysis.csv"  # Replace with the path to save the analysis result
```

#### Step 3: Run the Script
Save the script as [Semantic Analysis using PSPNet](semantic_analysis.py). Run the script using the following command:
```bash
python semantic_analysis.py
```
