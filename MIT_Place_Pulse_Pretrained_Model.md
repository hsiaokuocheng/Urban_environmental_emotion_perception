- **MIT Place Pulse Pretrained Model**

    "We used data from this research to predict environmental emotions in Matsu and Chiayi."

    This study originated from the "Place Pulse" crowdsourcing platform, where participants answered evaluative questions like "Which place looks safer?" or "Which place is more lively?" by selecting one of two images. 

    The first version of Place Pulse (1.0) collected over 500,000 preference data points for around 4,000 images from cities such as Boston, New York, Linz, and Salzburg. The updated version (Place Pulse 2.0) expanded to include images from over 50 cities and collected more than 1 million data points.
